2. Make sure to unwrap UV2 for lightmap baking (you might need to make the car scene local and save the scene)
3. Bake the lighting on the LightmapGI
4. Open the resulting exr file in a program like GIMP and crop it
5. Export as a PNG or a different format of your choice
6. Duplicate the materials/shadow_preset.tres material and set the texture there
7. Play with the settings to make it look good (the plane size is 4x4, adjust the scale of the lightmap plane (not of the mesh, it's made with 512x512 result in mind!) if you want a different size)
8. Create a MeshInstance3D with a BoxMesh with appropriate scale
9. Put the resulting material on the BoxMesh
10. Your car now has a fake shadow!"
