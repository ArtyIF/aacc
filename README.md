# Arty's Arcadey Car Controller

A very work-in-progress car controller that kinda resembles Midnight Club
physics? I guess? Includes a very basic demo scene and only one proper car.
The demo scene is meant to be run at stable 60 FPS or its multiple at the
moment, else expect a lot of jitter.

## Demo Scene controls
- W/S (keyboard), RT/LT (gamepad) - gas and brake/reverse
- A/D (keyboard), Left Stick Left/Right (gamepad) - steer
- Space (keyboard), X (Xbox gamepad), Cross (DualShock), Y (Switch gamepad) -
  handbrake

## Tricks

- Hold the handbrake (Space) and steer at a high enough speed to perform a 180
  turn!
