# Arty's Arcadey Car Controller

A very work-in-progress car controller that kinda resembles Midnight Club
physics? I guess? Includes a very basic demo scene and only one proper car.
The demo scene is meant to be run at stable 60 FPS or its multiple at the
moment, else expect a lot of jitter.

I'm uploading it this early because tomorrow there's a chance I won't be able to
work on it in a year (or possibly ever again). It's a long story.
