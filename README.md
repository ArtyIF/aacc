# AACC

A very work-in-progress car controller. Includes a very basic demo.

This branch makes AACC plugin-based. It's very work-in-progress. If you need
a car controller now, check out the `master` branch. You will still need to work
on it a bit, however.

**NOTE**: please pay attention to the `attribution.txt` files in the
`addons/aacc` folder! Some files' licenses require attribution if you're going
to use them!

## Dependencies
- Godot 4.4+
- Blender 3.5 or later (3.0-3.4 might also work) for the demo
