# THE GITHUB VERSION WILL NO LONGER BE UPDATED!

I messed up while trying to migrate to LFS and Codeberg. I've started [a new repository on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ArtyIF/aacc). This version will be around for archival purposes.

# AACC

A very work-in-progress car controller. Includes a very basic demo.

This car controller is still very much work-in-progress!

**NOTE**: please pay attention to the `attribution.txt` files in the
`addons/aacc` folder! Some files' licenses require attribution if you're going
to use them!

## Dependencies
- Godot 4.5+ (at least dev5)
- Blender 3.5 or later (3.0-3.4 might also work) for the demo
