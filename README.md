# Arty's Arcadey Car Controller

A very work-in-progress car controller that kinda resembles Midnight Club
physics? I guess? Includes a very basic demo scene and only one proper car.
The demo scene is meant to be run at stable 60 FPS or its multiple at the
moment, else expect a lot of jitter. Use WASD and space to control the scene,
other control methods are not implemented right now (but you can in Project →
Project Settings… → Input Map).
